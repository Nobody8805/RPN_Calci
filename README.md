# RPN_Calci
A pocket calculator that works on Reverse Polish Notations (Postfix Notations) 

First proper modular c project which was inspired by the book "C programing language" written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. Amazing read tbh.

---HEADER FILES IN C---
In this project, we have a calc.h header file. Header files usually contain function prototypes and Macros. To include them in a .c file, we must write " #include "respective_header_file.h" ".
